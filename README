Welcome to Empire 4, code-named Wolfpack.

See file `CREDITS' for a list of contributors.

Directory `doc' has additional information.  File `doc/README'
describes the files there and what they talk about.

To build the server and set up a game, follow the steps below.

(1) Unpacking the source tree

    If you downloaded a tarball, unpack it.

    If you cloned a git repository, run bootstrap.  This requires
    recent versions of Autoconf and Automake to be installed.  See
    also doc/contributing.

(2) Building a server

    Prerequisites: IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (POSIX.1-2001) with the X/Open
    System Interfaces Extension, GNU make, Perl, and either nroff or
    GNU troff (`groff').

    See file `INSTALL' for detailed compilation and installation
    instructions.  Quick guide for the impatient: run configure; make;
    make install.  The last step is optional; everything runs fine
    right from the build tree.

    If configure reports "readline: no" in its configuration summary,
    fancy line editing doesn't work in the client.  Commonly caused by
    not having development libraries installed.  On Linux, try
    installing readline-devel.

    If configure reports "terminfo: no" in its configuration summary,
    highlighting doesn't work in the client.  Commonly caused by not
    having development libraries installed.  On Linux, try installing
    ncurses-devel.

    If make fails without doing anything, you're probably not using
    GNU make.  Some systems have it installed as `gmake'.

    Solaris supports POSIX.1-2001, but you need to set up your
    environment for that.  Try

        SHELL=/usr/xpg4/bin/sh
        PATH=/usr/xpg6/bin:/usr/xpg4/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:$PATH

    See standards(5) for details.

    Likewise, AIX needs XPG_SUS_ENV=ON.

(3) Creating a game

    * Create a configuration for your game.  make install installs one
      in $prefix/etc/empire/econfig ($prefix is /usr/local unless you
      chose something else with configure).  You can use pconfig to
      create another one.

    * Edit your configuration file.  See doc/econfig for more
      information.

      Unless you put your configuration file in the default location
      (where make install installs it), you have to use -e with all
      programs to make them use your configuration.

    * Run files to set up your data directory.

    * Run fairland to create a world.  For a sample world, try
      `fairland 10 30'.  This creates file ./newcap_script, which will
      be used below.  You can edit it to change country names and
      passwords.

      Check out fairland's manual page for more information.

    * Start the server.  For development, you want to run it with -d
      in a debugger, see doc/debugging.  Do not use -d for a real
      game!

    * Log in as deity POGO with password peter.  This guide assumes
      you use the included client `empire', but other clients should
      work as well.

      For help, try `info'.

      To change the deity password, use `change re <password>'.

    * Create countries with `exec newcap_script'.

    Your game is now up!

Naturally, there's more to running a real game than that, but that's
beyond the scope of this file.
