The files in this directory are various utility scripts/programs
submitted by various people for doing routine maintainence on the
server, such as keeping it alive, making maps, posting to newsgroups,
starting blitzes, etc.

While we provide these files for your convenience, they are not an
"official" part of the server.  Therefore, you can e-mail us with
problems with them, but we may or may not know the answers and/or how
to fix any problems.  Some of the files have the author's e-mail in
them, and others are anonymous submissions, so you may want to try
to contact the authors if all else fails (but try us first, as we might
know.)

Wolfpack!
