.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fairland
is a program which creates land and ore for Empire.  It
should be run after
.I files
has been run and before
.I emp_server
has been started.  This is a land generator for empire that creates a
specified number of continents, and spaces them evenly accross the
map.  It tries to make all of them the same size, and makes sure that
they don't meet.  It gives each start island exactly the same
distribution of resources and the same number of mountains.  You can
get nearly any kind of map you want by choosing the right arguments.
