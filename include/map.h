/*
 * Width of the body of a map using @persec characters per sector.
 *
 * One row shows WORLD_X/2 sectors, separated by one space.  Requires
 * WORLD_X/2 * (@persec+1) - 1 characters.
 *
 * Every other row is indented so that the center of the first sector
 * is aligned with the space separating the first two sectors in the
 * adjacent rows.  For odd @persec, that's (@persec+1)/2 additional
 * characters.  For even @persec, it's either @persec/2 or @persec/2 + 1,
 * depending on whether we align the character left or right of the
 * center with the space (the map will look rather odd either way).
 *
 * We need one more character for the terminating zero.
