Natural resources gold, oil and uran deplete much slower than usual.
A 100% gold resource contains 2500d, a 100% oil resource contains
2500o, and a 100% uranium resource contains 500u.  Fully depleting a
sector will take you several updates, and a small fraction of the
resource contents will be lost.

Gold in mountains does not deplete at all.
.s1
Oil production does not depend on tech; you don't have to micro-manage
to conserve oil.

time.

Everything you do in this game is logged by the deities for their own
nefarious purposes.  However, the logs are treated confidentially.
