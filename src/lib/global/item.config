#   Derived from item.c; no known contributors.
#

# The item types (column uid) must match the compiled-in types defined
# in item.h.

# Columns pkg are indexed by packing types in compiled-in table
# packing.

# Column pow should ensure that producing stuff doesn't lose power.
# For instance, if 1s takes 2l 1h $3, worth 0.02, 0.04 and 0.01
# respectively, and production efficiency is ~0.9, then 1s should be
# worth no less than 0.11 / 0.9 =~ 0.122.

# Do not edit this file to customize a game!  Create your own custom
# configuration file(s), best next to your econfig, and name them in
# econfig key custom_tables.
