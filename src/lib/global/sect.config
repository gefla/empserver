# The sector types (column uid) must match the compiled-in types
# defined in sect.h.

# Available capability flags are in compiled-in table sect-chr-flags.
# info Sector-types should document them all.

# Sector terrain (column terra) is the uid of the underlying terrain
# sector type.  Sector types that occur in that column are terrain
# types, and must have themselves as terrain.

# Available products (column prd) are in product.config.  Navigation
# types (column nav) are in compiled-in table sector-navigation.
# Packing types (column pkg) are in compiled-in table packing.

# All sectors with the same terrain and without capability deity
# should have the same population limit (column maxpop), or else
# players can abuse redesignation to mass-murder people.

# A sector with urban packing (urba in column pkg) is a big city.
# Column maxpop applies at 0% efficiency.  The limit at 100% is ten
# times as large, up to the general item limit 9999.

# Do not edit this file to customize a game!  Create your own custom
# configuration file(s), best next to your econfig, and name them in
# econfig key custom_tables.
