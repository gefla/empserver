# Available item types (columns ct and type) are in item.config.
# Levels (columns lev and nlndx) are in compiled-in table level.
# Resources (column nrndx) are in compiled-in table resources.

# A product is either an item (value other than -1 in column type) or
# a level (value other than none in column lev).

# Products with a value other than none in column nrndx mine that
# natural resource.  When nrdep is non-zero, mining depletes the
# resource.  The smaller the value, the slower the depletion.

# If you customize constituents (columns ct and ca), you may need to
# customize item.config column power, too.

# Do not edit this file to customize a game!  Create your own custom
# configuration file(s), best next to your econfig, and name them in
# econfig key custom_tables.
