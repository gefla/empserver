/*
 * Receive a line of input from the current player.
 * If the player's aborted flag is set, return -1 without receiving
 * input.
 * Else receive one line and store it in @cmd[@size].
 * This may block for input, yielding the processor.  Flush buffered
 * output when blocking, to make sure player sees the prompt.
 * If the player's connection has the I/O error or EOF indicator set,
 * or the line is "aborted", set the player's aborted flag and return
 * -1.
 * If we block and time out, set the EOF indicator on the player's
 * connection, set the player's aborted flag, and return -1.
 * If the line is "ctld", set the player's eof and aborted flag and
 * return -1.
 * Else return the length of the line.
 * Design bug: there is no way to indicate truncation of a long line.
